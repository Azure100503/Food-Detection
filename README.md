# Food-Detection
## Description
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can classify food items into nutritional groups and determine whether a given meal meets nutritional adequacy based on dietary guidelines. This system will aid in monitoring and planning balanced diets by evaluating the nutritional content of meals from images.
## Data Collection
We collect data from Google Images based on key word
## Data labeling 
After having unlabeled dataset, we upload the dataset on RoboFlow to label their images

## YOLOv8 
We use pre-trained model YOLOv8 for this project
